# Portfolio

On Jan 9th 2024, I started working on my portfolio to give me the confidence I need when applying for software engineering internships and jobs and preparing for interviews. This time round I hope I will not give up. All I want is to:
- travel the world working with my laptop
- invest to secure my future 
- open my dream beauty parlour business!! 
- live my dream life and drive my dream car
- afford music studio and vocal coach
Period!!!
